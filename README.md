# Mini Java Game
This is a small project that I did during my free time on the semester break. The purpose of me doing this project is to sharpen my java coding skill and also to remember back what I have learnt during school so I will not forget how to code. This project features a local database to allow users to register and login to their account. Once they are logged in, they can choose to manage their credits, play games or log out. Users can choose to either withdraw or deposit credits to their account which works like a simple ATM. For games, currently there are 2 games for the player to choose from, which are coin flip and lucky number. Users have to guess head or tail for the coin flip and if they guessed correctly, they can get 2x the amount of credits that they have bet in a game but they will lose all credits they have bet in a game if they guessed wrongly. For the lucky number game, users have to guess the correct number ranging from 1-10 that the system will randomly generated and if they guessed correctly, they will get 5x the amount of credits they bet in the game. Of course if they guessed wrongly, the credits that they bet will be lost.
